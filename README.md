<h1>Hacking Metasploitable</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves using Kali Linux to explore and exploit vulnerabilities in Metasploitable 2, a deliberately insecure Linux virtual machine designed for testing and training purposes. The objective is to understand common security flaws, how they are exploited, and how to mitigate them.
<br />
