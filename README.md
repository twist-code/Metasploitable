<h1>Hacking Metasploitable</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves using Kali Linux to explore and exploit vulnerabilities in Metasploitable 2, a deliberately insecure Linux virtual machine designed for testing and training purposes. The objective is to understand common security flaws, how they are exploited, and how to mitigate them.
<br />

<h2>Skills Obtained</h2>

- <b>Network Scanning and Enumeration: </b> Using tools like Nmap to discover hosts, open ports, and services running on a network.
- <b>Vulnerability Identification:</b> Identifying common vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
- <b>Exploitation Techniques:</b> Using Metasploit and other tools to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
- <b>Password Cracking:</b> Use tools like Hydra to perform brute-force attacks and understand password security.
- <b>Web Application Testing:</b> Identifying and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications using tools like Burp Suite and Nikto.
- <b>Traffic Analysis:</b> Using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, helping to understand how data flows in a network and how attacks can be detected.
- <b>Post-Exploitation:</b> Techniques for maintaining access and gathering further information after exploiting a system.
- <b>Mitigation Strategies</b> The methods to secure systems and prevent the exploitation of similar vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nmap</b> 
- <b>Metasploit Framework</b>
- <b>Netcat</b> 
- <b>Burp Suite </b>
- <b>Wireshark</b> 
- <b>Nikto</b>
- <b>Hydra</b>

 <h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Target Environment: </b> Metasploitable VM
- <b>Attacker Environment:</b> Kali Linux VM
